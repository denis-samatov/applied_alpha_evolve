## About the project

Recent advances in automated solution search — exemplified by Google's
[AlphaEvolve framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13131) — highlight the effectiveness
of combining large language models with evolutionary search to solve hard optimization
problems. AlphaEvolve sets a new standard in this space by pairing model-based candidate
generation with rigorous evaluation. In this study, we run a comparative analysis of
three open-source evolutionary frameworks — OpenAlpha_Evolve, OpenEvolve, and
MetaEvolve — on a circle-packing optimization task, using AlphaEvolve as the reference
benchmark. The analysis covers both framework architecture and the effect of different
LLMs. We also add logging and visualization tooling to better understand the
evolutionary process and how different models behave. Experimental results show that
MetaEvolve, using Qwen models, achieves the best solution quality among the open
frameworks (sum of radii = 2.6238), slightly behind the AlphaEvolve reference (2.635).
This work lays a foundation for further research into LLM-driven evolutionary
algorithms for optimization.

## 📁 Frameworks studied

#### [`MetaEvolve`](meta_evolve/) (closed-source repository)

> Description and benchmark results included; code has been modified and is still
> being improved.

- Multi-Island MAP-Elites algorithm implementation
- DAG-based program execution system
- Asynchronous architecture with Redis persistence
- Quality-diversity optimization support

#### [`OpenEvolve`](open_evolve/) ([upstream repository](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve))

> Description, benchmark results, and code with our modifications included.

- Implementation of AlphaEvolve concepts from Google DeepMind
- Automated code generation and optimization
- Web interface for monitoring the evolutionary process
- Multi-provider LLM support

#### [`OpenAlpha_Evolve`](open_alpha_evolve/) ([upstream repository](https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAlpha_Evolve))

> Description and benchmark results included; not selected for further development due
> to its limitations.

- Analysis of an open implementation of AlphaEvolve concepts
- Study of its agentic architecture and modular design
- Performance and scalability evaluation
- Comparative study of different approaches to evolutionary programming

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Study the architecture and internal logic of existing AlphaEvolve implementations
   (frameworks).
2. Test the system with different LLMs — from large proprietary models to smaller
   open ones — and evaluate its robustness and adaptability. Answer the question of
   whether this approach is viable for open-source solutions.
3. Identify possible improvements:
   - **Conceptual**: better mutation strategies, task-adapted metrics.
   - **Visual**: clearer visualization of the evolutionary process.
   - **Technical**: richer logging, solution-trajectory tracking.
